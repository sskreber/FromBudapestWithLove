    <!-- Chill fragment location description -->
    <string name="chill_fragment_loc_description01">Lukacs Thermal Bath</string>
    <string name="chill_fragment_loc_description02">Gellert Thermal Baths </string>
    <string name="chill_fragment_loc_description03">Szechenyi Medicinal Bath</string>
    <string name="chill_fragment_loc_description04">Artists performing here are celebrated across Europe, and the local performers are giving it their all too: Hungarians take their humour and circus seriously. The building itself is also worth checking out!
    </string>
    <string name="chill_fragment_loc_description05">Budapest Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden
</string>
    <string name="chill_fragment_loc_description06">Tropicarium </string>

    <!-- Libraries fragment location description -->
    <string name="libraries_fragment_loc_description01">Not many libraries can claim that they live in a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so this one will blow your mind. Situated in the mostly Barque Buda Castle, the library gives off a classy and elegant vibe.

    </string>
    <string name="libraries_fragment_loc_description02">This is the city\'s most popular library, as it has its own branch in about every district, has comfortable reading rooms in the centre branch, and offers unbeatable prices for the browsing of its sizeable collection.</string>
    <string name="libraries_fragment_loc_description03">Classy and comfy at the same time, this place will feel welcoming and its architecture is impressive too! You can also purchase used books here. Watch out for the Hungarian chess and go players at its reception hall!
    </string>
    <string name="libraries_fragment_loc_description04">Yet another classy historical building, this is Europe after all. Situated near the city centre and one of Eotvos Lorand University\'s legendary campuses, it\'s definitely worth a look.

    </string>
    <string name="libraries_fragment_loc_description05">Situated at a small business centre, its home building will impress you less, but the quiet, Japanese-speaking staff &amp; their unique collection of textbooks, manga, journals &amp; novels definitely will.

    </string>
    <string name="libraries_fragment_loc_description06">A walk by the river side near this building will already give you a good excuse to check it out, not to mention its unique little French shop and a book store selling exclusively French books on the ground floor of the building.
    </string>

    <!-- Castles fragment location description -->
    <string name="castles_fragment_loc_description01">Not exactly in Budapest, but only a few minutes drive away; if you\'re only going to see one castle in Hungary, this better be the one. Join a castle tour, and visit the garden as well!
    </string>
    <string name="castles_fragment_loc_description02">The majority of the building was built in Baroque style, and is now home to several cultural units (museums and libraries).
    </string>
    <string name="castles_fragment_loc_description03">Situated on the side of a lake, this one gives off a calming vibe. If you can\'t pick a style you love, no worries, as this castle has features of the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque too!</string>

    <!-- Eateries fragment location description -->
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description01">Probably the city\'s best homey ramen place with quality ingredients and an authentic Japanese taste and scenario too. Here you can also find Japanese beers like Asahi, which are hard to come by anywhere else in Hungary. You are free (and downright recommended) here to slurp, as is the Japanese custom with hot good ramen.</string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description02">Undoubtedly the city\'s best sushi restaurant (both sit-in and takeaway or online order), with unbeatable prices, always freshly made products and a wide choice in types of sushi and sashimi as well as Japanese desserts and ramen.</string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description03">A relatively new (and small) establishment with the feel and taste of home-cooked Japanese food, which seems to be so popular that at times they have to close early as then run out of ingredients!</string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description04">This place is not about sushi but real home-cooked Japanese food instead (like ramen and rice-based dishes), with a Japanese chef and a Japanese-speaking Hungarian staff! Popular with the Japanese living in Budapest - that has got to be a good sign!</string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description05">A pricey tourist attraction with several good points: English-speaking staff, central location in the city, and&#8230; glorious barbecue! To top this all, the restaurant itself is very close to St. Stephen\'s Basilica, so it\'s easy to build it into your trip.</string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description06">Pricey but quality food populated by foreigners as the locals can barely afford such gourmery&#8230; But don\'t be offended by the \'standard\' rude Hungarian service! Craft burgers and good meat are definitely priorities of the locals, so make sure to put at least one good burger place onto your to-do list.</string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description07">Armed with an English-speaking staff and a wide variety of menu options for a low price, this place is worth to check out as well as its location itself, the famous American-Hungarian university which has been making the news lately for being resented by the law-making body of the country.</string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description08">A real gem in the outskirts of the town: a themed restaurant, which is rare in this country. Their theme is the novels and life of amazing comedic writer Jeno Rejto, author of \'Dirty Fred, the Captain\'. Their dishes are served on a printed paper of custom-made comic book page, and their secetions are named after popular Rejto characters and adventures. By the way, the cuisine is good too! </string>
    <string name="eateries_fragment_loc_description09">Showcasing Hungary\'s time spent under the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, this place, as its names indicates, serves to offer you the best wiener schnitzel in town (which has to be big enough to fill a whole plate, and slightly more&#8230;).</string>
